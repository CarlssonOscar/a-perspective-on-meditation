        <h2>Meditation Tips</h2>

        <p>
            The hardest part about meditation is not the meditation, we become better at most things we put our minds
            to. The hardest part is to get a regular practice going.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you want to meditate?</h3>

        <p>
            The first tip is, figure out why you want to meditate. As with most things, we don’t stick to things that we
            don’t do for a reason and meditation is not about reaching a goal and then quitting. Figure out why you
            would never want to stop. It may sound hard, but if you think about it most of us have habits we do every
            day, we shower and brush our teeth. I guess my commitment do meditation is quite similar to those habits.
            But I think of it as mental instead of physical hygiene.</p>

        <h3>Creating the habit.</h3>

        <p>
            As with most habits it’s a good idea to set up your life in a way where it’s hard not to do the habit. I
            usually set an alarm with meditation music or a guided meditation instead of a regular alarm and put on a
            second alarm so I know when to stop. I know everybody can’t do this, but if you can, put your cellphone on
            airplane mode during the night. In the morning when you out of habit pull up your cellphone you may realize
            that your supposed to be meditating, not scrolling through Instagram. My experience is also that my mind is
            calmer in the morning if I have not started the day looking at my cellphone. </p>

        <h3>Write</h3>

        <p>
            Write down what you need to do during the day, prior to starting. This will make it easier to go deeper in
            to the meditation faster.</p>

        <h3>You can manipulate your thoughts.</h3>

        <p>
            Try stating ten or twenty things your truly thankful for in the begging of your meditation. You will notice
            that the mind will have more positive thoughts during the mediation, and sometimes through the day. This
            practice, at least for me, makes it easier to notice thoughts and can be a good way of understanding how
            meditation works. You may also realize that one of the reasons we don’t always have very positive thoughts
            is that we expose ourselves to lots of negativity, it’s everywhere. On the news, on social media, even the
            positive things on social media may make us jealous of the things we don’t have. It’s necessarily not a good
            idea to stop altogether with these things, it may make us ignorant, as will only sticking to one source of
            information. But limiting your consumption of it will likely make your thoughts more positive.</p>

        <h3>You don’t have to sit down to meditate.</h3>

        <P>
            I think that when most people think of meditation they think of a person sitting with calming music in the
            background. But you don’t have to do this to notice thoughts. Several times during the day I notice that my
            mind is obsessing over something. When I do I usually go “Hi brain, what you up to”, and the go back to
            focusing on my breath. Than my mind usually calms down.</P>

        <h3>Listen to guided meditations.</h3>

        <P>
            There are several people who hold guided meditations. People who know lots more than I do. My favorite is
            Tara Brach, you can find her on several music apps, she also has a website. Sam Harris is another favorite.
            He has a meditation app called Waking Up. Both these people have talks about world problems, about human
            cognition and lots of other interesting topics. I think it’s important to expose ourselves to other people’s
            ideas. Just because we have an opinion about something doesn’t mean we are right. Remember that most minds
            hate change, and will often try fooling you in to believing that your right, even when your wrong.
        </P>

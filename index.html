        <h2>Why Meditate?</h2>

        <p>
            There are several reasons as to why someone starts a meditation journey.
            Needless if it’s to improve focus, improving sleep, lower stress levels, become more objective, be more kind
            to one self and others or to heal trauma, they all require one to become more self-aware and present. Lots
            of people are not aware that they are thinking, our thoughts roam around in a quite often random order, and
            we still identify with them. As if our thoughts are the truth and we should live by the rules they appoint.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thoughts are often about what was or what could be, past and future. It can be helpful at times, but not
            always. All humans have a trait called negativity bias, you can think of it as risk assessment. It’s there
            to help us avoid danger, but sometimes, it restrains us. The thoughts partly involve guilt, fears and
            doubts. During change, it’s required of us to wander in to the unknown. For lots of people it’s scary, we
            know what we have, but not what we are getting. And the negativity bias only tells us why we should not go
            through with this proposed change. The people we talk to might also only see why a potential choice is not a
            good idea. For many, the negativity bias rules our choices and what we believe about ourselves. You may get
            a hundred nice compliments and one cruel remark and what sticks is usually the cruel one. We compare
            ourselves to others and only seem to see what we don’t have. I also believe our negativity bias is why
            negative news rules media, we seem to devour negative news and then let that impact our world view.
        </p>

        <p>
            One can not to talk about negativity bias without also talking about confirmation bias. It’s the part of our
            thoughts that try to make us stick to what we feel like we know. The brain seems to hate change, and the
            confirmation bias will only tell us why the road we have taken, the ideas we have about ourselves and the
            world, are the right ones. It’s the part of our thoughts that make some people think that vaccination is a
            bad choice. When they have settled on the idea that it’s the truth, it’s very hard to convince them that
            there wrong. The two combined can make people truly irrational.

        </p>

        <p>
            On top of these human traits we, despite feeling like individuals, are flock animals. It’s understandable,
            who truly likes to be alone? Probably no one. But to some of us it’s so important to us to fit in to the
            flock we have been born in to or have chosen that we conform to their ideals, instead of being true to
            ourselves. For some of us these three human traits have convinced us that being inauthentic, and probably
            unhappy, is the right choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            As humans, we are subjective, emotional beings, what we feel can often have an even greater impact than our
            thoughts on our head space. We may meet an irresponsive driver during our path to work, become angry and
            then keep being angry for the rest of the day. That is in no shape or form helpful, to us or to others. We
            may look at the news and see something truly dreadful and let that impact us. Sometimes the frustration we
            feel about the world’s problems can be helpful, it can be a driver for change. But if we are not willing to
            try to make that change happen, or can’t, then what is the point of feeling angry or frustrated?
        </p>

        <p>
            When we lose individuals we love, some of us seem to turn our emotions off, we shut down because it seems too
            painful to feel. Of course, all people have their own path of grief, some longer than others. But needless,
            we all must grief, we need to process the distressful parts of our lives. Otherwise we can never truly let
            go and move on. What we don’t process, will keep affecting us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meditation can help us know when to give in to our emotions, and when not to. When to listen to our
            thoughts,and when not to. I guess one also could call meditation the art of sometimes not giving a fuck about what we
            think, what other people think and still be kind to ourselves and others. Mediation can be hard at times,
            because it can let us face what we try to repress, but I promise you, it’s worth it.

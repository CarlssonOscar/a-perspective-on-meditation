        <h2>Why Meditate?</h2>
    
        <p>
            There are several reasons as to why someone starts a meditation journey.
            Needless if it’s to improve focus, improving sleep, lower stress levels, become more objective, be more kind to
            one self and others or to heal trauma. They all require one to become more self-aware and present. Lots of
            people are not aware that they are thinking, our thoughts roam around in a quite often random order, and we
            still identify with them. As if our thoughts are the truth and we should live by the rules they appoint. As if
            we are our egos.</p>
    
        <p>
            Thoughts are often about what was or what could be, past and future. It can be helpful at times, but not always.
            All humans have their negativity bias, it’s there to help us avoid danger, but sometimes, it restrains us. They
            partly involve guilt our fears and doubts. Change require us to wander in to the unknown. For lots of people
            it’s scary, we know what we have, but not what we are getting. And our negativity bias only tells us why we
            should not go through with this proposed change. The people we talk to might also only see why it’s not a good
            idea. For many, our negativity bias rules our choices and what we believe about ourselves. You may get a hundred
            nice compliments and one cruel remark and what sticks is usually the cruel one. We compare ourselves to others
            and only seem to see what we don’t have. I also believe our negativity bias is why negative news rules media, we
            seem to devour negative news and let that impact our world view.</p>
    
        <p>
            As humans, we are subjective, emotional beings, what we feel can often have an even greater impact than our
            thoughts on our head space. We may meet an irresponsive driver during our path to work, become angry and then
            keep being angry for the rest of the day. That is in no shape or form helpful, to us or to others. We may look
            at the news and see something truly dreadful and let that impact us. Sometimes the frustration we feel about the
            world’s problems can be helpful, it can be a driver for change. But if we are not willing to try to make that
            change happen, or can’t, then what is the point of feeling angry or frustrated?</p>
    
        <p>
            When we lose people we love, some of us seem to turn our emotions off, we shut down because it seems too painful
            to feel. Of course, all people have their own path of grief, some longer than others. But needless, we all must
            grief, we need to process the distressful parts of our lives. Otherwise we can never truly let go and move on.
            What we don’t process, will keep affecting us.</p>
    
        <p>
            Meditation can help us know when to give in to our emotions, and when not to. When to listen to our thoughts, and
            when not to. I guess one also could call meditation the art of sometimes not giving a fuck about what we think,
            what other people think and still be kind to ourselves and others. Mediation can be hard at times, because it
            can let us face what we try to repress, but I promise you, it’s worth it.</p>

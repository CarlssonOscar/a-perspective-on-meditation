        <h2>How To Meditate</h2>
        <p>
            Find a sitting position you’re comfortable with. Make sure your posture is upright, put your hands in your
            lap and relax. You can sit on a cushion, in a sofa or on a chair, with your legs crossed or firmly planted
            on the floor. Avoid lying down if you don’t want to fall asleep. If you want something in the background put
            on a meditation music list. Set a timer, you can start with five or ten minutes. You can increase the amount
            of time as you progress. I usually go between fifteen minutes up to an hour depending on what I want to
            accomplish.</p>
        <p>
            If you want to be less distracted during the day, a shorter time is plenty for most. If you want to go
            deeper, a longer time is usually needed. In the beginning, lots of my thoughts are about what I’m going to
            do that day. As time passes my thoughts usually go to places of what I feel is of greater importance. It can
            be something I regret, something I try to repress, something I appreciate, something I feel I should do.
            From the experiences I have gathered through meditation, the talks I have listened to and books I’ve read
            about cognition over the years these seems to be very common thought patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to be kind to yourself and your thoughts, trying to avoid something usually doesn’t work. If
            you tell yourself to not think about a pink dinosaur with wings, you will inevitably think of that. A better
            approach is to observe the thought, say thank you for letting me know and then move on. If that does not
            work and the thought keeps coming up session after session, maybe you should investigate the thought, is it
            reasonable that you feel this way about what comes up? Mediation can help us observe thoughts instead of
            identifying with them. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense that we think and feel the way we feel about
            something that has happened to us, about something we did. If we realize this, it can be easier to let go of
            the thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes it does make sense that we feel remorse, meditation can be a great moral compass. Lots of people,
            let’s face it, does some stupid shit during their lives, towards themselves and towards others. Apologizing
            to ourselves, or others you may have hurt, can be of great relief. Maybe you do not accept it at first,
            keeping trying you will get there. Maybe the people you hurt doesn’t accept your apology, at least you have
            done the thing you could do. We can’t change everything, but it’s likely a better approach to life to focus
            on what we can do, than being frustrated about what we can’t do.</p>
        <p>
            I use several methods to mediate, the most common one is to focus on the breath. During meditation, your
            mind will wander multiple times, far away from the breath. When you notice that your mind is wandering, go
            back to the breath. With experience, you will get better at noticing thoughts arising. Thoughts arise
            semi-randomly, sometimes it will be about something that does not matter. Sometimes you will hear your mind
            say that you should stop meditating. Sometimes it’s a pile of bullshit you tell yourself. Sometimes it can
            be something of importance. With time, it gets easier to tell the difference. Some thoughts are worth
            exploring, some you should let go and go back to your breath. A good way of knowing if your lost in thought
            or observing thoughts is to try to recollect what your thoughts were about; you might notice that it’s
            harder than it sounds.</p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that people meditate for different reasons, and there is no right way of doing it. For some,
            the only focus they have is to notice thoughts and coming back to the breath, bodily sensations or to
            silently go through a mantra. If one’s objective only is to become more present, this is the approach I
            would take. I do this quite a lot, and one can reach levels of presence that are hard to comprehend through
            this method. It’s hard to describe, but it sorts of feels like your detached from your body, your so focused
            that everything else than presence seem to vanish. I know it sound counter intuitive, but it can be a truly
            euphoric and calming experience at the same time.</p>
        <p>
            Another method is to focus on bodily sensations. You may notice that your body is tense, if your stressed
            your jaw might be clenched Try scanning your body from head to toes and relax the parts of your body that
            are tense. Choose a body part to focus on. If you meditate with someone, hold their hand, the sensations
            that occur will be your area of focus.</p>
        <p>
            The last method is looking at art. Pick a piece of art that you like and observe it. Thoughts and emotions
            will inevitably rise. The art may awake certain emotions depending on what it portrays and your
            interpretation of it. You may start analyzing what the artist had in mind when making it. It may remind you
            about certain things in your life. Whenever you notice that your attention has drifted away from the
            artwork, go back and watch it.</p>
        <p>
            Meditation is a great tool for mental health. But don’t forget to talk about the road bumps you hit in your
            life. Needless if it’s with a friend or a psychologist it can be of great help to process what happens to
            you during life with someone else. Our mind often tells us why we are right and not why we are wrong,
            listening to other people’s ideas with an open mind can be of great help.</p>
